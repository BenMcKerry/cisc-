# cisc-235-projects

CISC 235 is a second-year computing course at Queen's University taken after CISC 124. All projects were written in Python.

Assignment 1.1: Created a generic Bag data structure which wrapped a list, as well as several helper functions.

Assignment 1.2: Compared the runtimes of linear search and a merge sort/binary search combination on large lists of integers using the timeit module to find the approximate point where the merge/binary combo became faster.

Assignment 2: Implemented a Binary Search Tree and related functions such as insert, getWeightBalanceFactor, getTreeDepth, etc. Also created a function which would load a tree from information in a .txt file using a stack.
